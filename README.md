### Bureau of Meteorology temperatures

This is an exploratory data analysis of daily maximum and minimum temperature trends for selected Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) weather stations. 
The data for this project can be found at the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml). I chose weather stations based on geographical dispersion and length of observation history.

The jupyter notebook (.ipynb extension) should be viewable, or alternatively the markdown file (.md extension) can be viewed. The objective of this project was to review temperature trends across time to see if temperatures are increasing, as depicted in the media constantly.
